# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **n8n-skills** repository - a collection of Claude Code skills designed to teach AI assistants how to build flawless n8n workflows using the n8n-mcp MCP server.

**Repository**: https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-skills

**Purpose**: Create 5 complementary meta-skills that provide expert guidance on using n8n-mcp MCP tools effectively for building n8n workflows.

**Architecture**:
- **n8n-mcp MCP Server**: Provides data access (525 nodes, validation, templates)
- **Claude Skills**: Provides expert guidance on HOW to use MCP tools
- **Together**: Expert workflow builder with progressive disclosure

```

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: n8n Expression Syntax (PoC - 4 files, ~350 lines)
- **Week 2**: n8n MCP Tools Expert + n8n Workflow Patterns
- **Week 3**: n8n Validation Expert + n8n Node Configuration
- **Week 4**: Testing, refinement, documentation
- **Week 5-6**: Distribution, plugin packaging

## Five Skills to Implement

### 1. n8n Expression Syntax
**Priority**: Foundation (Week 1)
- Teaches correct n8n expression syntax ({{}} patterns)
- Covers common mistakes and fixes
- Files: SKILL.md, COMMON_MISTAKES.md, EXAMPLES.md

### 2. n8n MCP Tools Expert
**Priority**: Highest (fixes 20% failure rate)
- Teaches how to use n8n-mcp MCP tools effectively
- Covers node discovery, validation, workflow management
- Files: SKILL.md, SEARCH_GUIDE.md, VALIDATION_GUIDE.md, WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md

### 3. n8n Workflow Patterns
**Priority**: High (addresses 813 webhook searches)
- Teaches proven workflow architectural patterns
- 5 patterns from 31,917 real workflows
- Files: SKILL.md + 5 pattern files (webhook, http, database, ai, scheduled)

### 4. n8n Validation Expert
**Priority**: Medium
- Interprets validation errors and guides fixing
- Handles false positives and validation loops
- Files: SKILL.md, ERROR_CATALOG.md, FALSE_POSITIVES.md

### 5. n8n Node Configuration
**Priority**: Medium
- Operation-aware node configuration guidance
- Property dependencies and common patterns
- Files: SKILL.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, OPERATION_PATTERNS.md

## Data-Driven Design

These skills are based on telemetry analysis of:
- 447,557 real MCP tool usage events
- 31,917 workflows created
- 19,113 validation errors
- 15,107 validation feedback loops

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this format:

```markdown
---
name: Skill Name
description: When to use this skill. Use when [trigger conditions].
---

# Skill Name

## [Content organized in sections]
```

## Development Approach

**Evaluation-Driven Development**:
1. Create 3+ evaluations FIRST for each skill
2. Establish baseline (test without skill)
3. Write minimal SKILL.md (under 500 lines)
4. Test against evaluations
5. Iterate until 100% pass
6. Add reference files as needed

## Key Implementation Guidelines

### File Organization
- Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines
- Split complex content into reference files
- Use markdown with clear sections
- Link between related files

### Skill Activation
Skills activate automatically when queries match their description triggers:
- "How do I write n8n expressions?" → n8n Expression Syntax
- "Find me a Slack node" → n8n MCP Tools Expert
- "Build a webhook workflow" → n8n Workflow Patterns

### Cross-Skill Integration
Skills are designed to work together:
- Use n8n Workflow Patterns to identify structure
- Use n8n MCP Tools Expert to find nodes
- Use n8n Node Configuration for setup
- Use n8n Expression Syntax for data mapping
- Use n8n Validation Expert to validate

## Important Patterns from Telemetry

### Most Common Tool Usage Pattern
```
search_nodes → get_node_essentials (9,835 occurrences, 18s avg)
```

### Most Common Validation Pattern
```
n8n_update_partial_workflow → n8n_validate_workflow (7,841 occurrences)
Avg 23s thinking, 58s fixing
```

### Most Used Tool
```
n8n_update_partial_workflow (38,287 uses, 99.0% success)
Avg 56 seconds between edits
```

## Working with This Repository

### When Adding New Skills
1. Create skill directory under `skills/`
2. Follow the structure in `docs/SKILLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
3. Write SKILL.md with frontmatter
4. Add reference files as needed
5. Create 3+ evaluations in `evaluations/`
6. Test thoroughly before committing

### When Creating Evaluations
Place in `evaluations/[skill-name]/eval-NNN-description.json`

Format:
```json
{
  "id": "skill-NNN",
  "skills": ["skill-name"],
  "query": "User question or scenario",
  "expected_behavior": [
    "List of expected behaviors",
    "What skill should do",
    "What content it should reference"
  ]
}
```

### Git Workflow
- Work on feature branches
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Test skills before pushing
- Keep main branch stable

## Requirements

- n8n-mcp MCP server installed and configured
- Claude Code, Claude.ai, or Claude API access
- Understanding of n8n workflow concepts

## Distribution

Final distribution will be:
1. **GitHub Repository**: Full source code and documentation
2. **Claude Code Plugin**: Packaged skills with plugin.json
3. **Individual Skill Uploads**: For Claude.ai users
